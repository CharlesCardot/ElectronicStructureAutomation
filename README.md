### Introduction

This repo is for the automation of nearly ab-initio Quanty calculations using the DFT + MLFT
pipeline established by Haverkort et. al (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.85.165113). For information
about how to use this pipeline, please visit the Quanty website (https://www.quanty.org/documentation/start),
specifically the example scripts from the Heidelberg workshops 
(https://www.quanty.org/workshop/heidelberg/october_2022/programme)

Over the years this repo has evolved into a patchwork combination of bash scripts and python plotting
utilities that basically no one but me understands. It's also been adapted to running similar
batch jobs of FEFF calculations, mostly for VtC-XES. This is not in any way intended for real users, 
and is mostly just a way for me to back up my scripts, please enter at your own risk.

Enjoy!
