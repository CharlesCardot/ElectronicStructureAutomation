✓ 1. Update the initial DFT step to ensure that convergence is achieved before 
progressing to the next step. Or at least add in some visualization of convergence.
2. Add a visualization of the FPLO crystal structure by parsing the out.scf file,
which we can now do with PyMatGen. This could be a nice way to avoid having to
go back to our VirtualBox machine every time to use xflo.
3. Add a way to generate input files directly from the materials project ID.
✓ 4. Add in band structure plots to DFT Due Diligence 
5. Add information from the quanty calculation about the 1s core hole thermally
averaged ground state properties (ex: spin, 3d level occupation)
6. Add something to the metadata at the beginning that reports the Point Group
of the local environment around the transition metal and the Space Group of the
crystal structure
